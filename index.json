Even with the coupling of adaptive optics and coronagraphy, the direct detection of off-axis sources such as circumstellar disks and exoplanets remains challenging due to the required high contrast and small angular resolution. Angular differential imaging (ADI) is an observational technique that introduces an angular diversity to help disentangle the signal of off-axis sources from the residual signal of the star in a post-processing step. *Aims.* While various detection algorithms have been proposed in the last decade to process ADI sequences and reach high contrast for the detection of point-like sources, very few methods are available to reconstruct meaningful images of extended features such as circumstellar disks. The purpose of this paper is to describe a new post-processing algorithm dedicated to the reconstruction of the spatial distribution of light (total intensity) received from off-axis sources, in particular from circumstellar disks. *Methods.* Built on the recent PACO algorithm dedicated to the detection of point-like sources, the proposed method is based on the local learning of patch covariances capturing the spatial fluctuations of the stellar leakages. From this statistical modeling, we develop a regularized image reconstruction algorithm (REXPACO) following an inverse problems approach based on a forward image formation model of the off-axis sources in the ADI sequences. *Results.* Injections of fake circumstellar disks in ADI sequences from the VLT/SPHERE-IRDIS instrument show that both the morphology and the photometry of the disks are better preserved by REXPACO compared to standard postprocessing methods such as cADI. In particular, the modeling of the spatial covariances proves useful in reducing typical ADI artifacts and in better disentangling the signal of these sources from the residual stellar contamination. The application to stars hosting circumstellar disks with various morphologies confirms the ability of REXPACO to produce images of the light distribution with reduced artifacts. Finally, we show how REXPACO can be combined with PACO to disentangle the signal of circumstellar disks from the signal of candidate point-like sources. *Conclusions.* REXPACO is a novel post-processing algorithm for reconstructing images of the circumstellar environment from high contrast ADI sequences.

To understand their formation and evolution mechanisms, we have initiated in 2015 the SPHERE infrared survey for exoplanets (SHINE), a systematic direct imaging survey of young, nearby stars to explore their demographics. *Aims.* We aim to detect and characterize the population of giant planets and brown dwarfs beyond the snow line around young, nearby stars. Combined with the survey completeness, our observations offer the opportunity to constrain the statistical properties (occurrence, mass and orbital distributions, dependency on the stellar mass) of these young giant planets. *Methods.* In this study, we present the observing and data analysis strategy, the ranking process of the detected candidates, and the survey performances for a subsample of 150 stars, which are representative of the full SHINE sample. The observations were conducted in an homogeneous way from February 2015 to February 2017 with the dedicated ground-based VLT/SPHERE instrument equipped with the IFS integral field spectrograph and the IRDIS dual-band imager covering a spectral range between 0.9 and 2.3 µm. We used coronographic, angular and spectral differential imaging techniques to reach the best detection performances for this study down to the planetary mass regime. *Results.* We have processed in a uniform manner more than 300 SHINE observations and datasets to assess the survey typical sensitivity as a function of the host star, and of the observing conditions. The median detection performance reaches 5σ-contrasts of 13 mag at 200 mas and 14.2 mag at 800 mas with the IFS (YJ and YJH bands), and of 11.8 mag at 200 mas, 13.1 mag at 800 mas and 15.8 mag at 3 as with IRDIS in H band, delivering one of the deepest sensitivity surveys so far for young nearby stars. A total of sixteen substellar companions were imaged in this first part of SHINE: seven brown dwarf companions, and ten planetary-mass companions. They include the two new discoveries HIP 65426 b and HIP 64892 B, but not the planets around PDS70 not originally select in the SHINE core sample. A total of 1483 candidates were detected, mainly in the large field-of-view of IRDIS. Color-magnitude diagrams, low-resolution spectrum when available with IFS, and follow-up observations, enabled to identify the nature (background contaminant or comoving companion) of about 86 % of them. The remaining cases are often connected to crowded field missing follow-up observations. Finally, although SHINE was not designed for disk searches, twelve circumstellar disks were imaged including three new detections around the HIP 73145, HIP 86598 and HD 106906 systems. *Conclusions.* Nowadays, direct imaging brings a unique opportunity to probe the outer part of exoplanetary systems beyond 10 au to explore planetary architectures as highlighted by the discoveries of one new exoplanet, one new brown dwarf companion, and three new debris disks during this early phase of SHINE. It also offers the opportunity to explore and revisit the physical and orbital properties of these young giant planets and brown dwarf companions (relative position, photometry and low resolution spectrum in near-infrared, predicted masses, contrast to search for additional companions). Finally, these results highlight the importance to finalize the SHINE systematic observation of about 500 young, nearby stars, for a full exploration of their outer part to explore the demographics of young giant planets beyond 10 au, and to nail down the most interesting systems for the next generation of high-contrast imagers on very large and extremely large telescopes.","tags":[],"title":"The SPHERE infrared survey for exoplanets (SHINE).

In particular, the detection of exoplanets and their characterization by direct imaging from the Earth is a hot topic. Beyond the detection of exoplanets, the reconstruction of circumstellar disks made of gas and dust is of primary astrophysical interest since exoplanets could form inside such structures by accretion. Microscopy is another field of study in which recent advances in terms of resolution and sensitivity have opened the door to new medical diagnoses. Among the large variety of imaging modalities, digital holography appears to be a cost-effective method of choice for characterizing microscopic objects. For both application fields, the detection, characterization and reconstruction of the objects of interest are very challenging due to the underlying low signal-to-noise ratio regime, thus requiring a fine processing of the data by dedicated and versatile algorithms. In this seminar, we will present some of the processing algorithms we have proposed in the context of high-contrast direct imaging, in astronomy, and of digital holography, in microscopy. The underlying imaging challenges are formalized within an inverse problems framework. The main focus is put on the use of statistical and/or physics based approaches to derive reliable and quantitative estimates characterizing the detected objects. Information redundancies (e.g., temporal, multi-spectral) are also exploited. Robust processing strategies are also considered to improve their systematic deployment on data often corrupted by outliers. All the developed algorithms are totally unsupervised: weighting and/or regularization parameters are estimated in a data-driven fashion making the methods efficient for the processing of real data of uneven quality.","tags":[],"title":"Object detection, characterization and reconstruction from faint signals in images: applications in astronomy and microscopy","type":"other-communication"},{"authors":["M.

As such, it offers several unique opportunities for detailed studies of planetary system formation and early evolution. *Aims.* We aim to further constrain the orbital and physical properties of β Pictoris b and c using a combination of high contrast imaging, long base-line interferometry, and RV data. We also predict the closest approaches or the transit times of both planets, and we constrain the presence of additional planets in the system. *Methods.* We obtained six additional epochs of SPHERE data, six additional epochs of GRAVITY data, and five additional epochs of RV data. We combined these various types of data in a single Markov-chain Monte Carlo analysis to constrain the orbital parameters and masses of the two planets simultaneously. The analysis takes into account the gravitational influence of both planets on the star and hence their relative astrometry. Secondly, we used the RV and high contrast imaging data to derive the probabilities of presence of additional planets throughout the disk, and we tested the impact of absolute astrometry. *Results.* The orbital properties of both planets are constrained with a semi-major axis of 9.8 ± 0.4 au and 2.7 ± 0.02 au for b and c, respectively, and eccentricities of 0.09 ± 0.1 and 0.27 ± 0.07, assuming the HIPPARCOS distance. We note that despite these low fitting error bars, the eccentricity of β Pictoris c might still be over-estimated. If no prior is provided on the mass of β Pictoris b, we obtain a very low value that is inconsistent with what is derived from brightness-mass models. When we set an evolutionary model motivated prior to the mass of β Pictoris b, we find a solution in the 10–11 MJup range. Conversely, β Pictoris c’s mass is well constrained, at 7.8 ± 0.4 MJup, assuming both planets are on coplanar orbits. These values depend on the assumptions on the distance of the β Pictoris system. The absolute astrometry HIPPARCOS-Gaia data are consistent with the solutions presented here at the 2σ level, but these solutions are fully driven by the relative astrometry plus RV data. Finally, we derive unprecedented limits on the presence of additional planets in the disk. We can now exclude the presence of planets that are more massive than about 2.5 MJup closer than 3 au, and more massive than 3.5 MJup between 3 and 7.5 au. Beyond 7.5 au, we exclude the presence of planets that are more massive than 1–2 MJup. *Conclusions.* Combining relative astrometry and RVs allows one to precisely constrain the orbital parameters of both planets and to give lower limits to potential additional planets throughout the disk. The mass of β Pictoris c is also well constrained, while additional RV data with appropriate observing strategies are required to properly constrain the mass of β Pictoris b.","tags":[],"title":"Unveiling the β Pictoris system, coupling high contrast imaging, interferometric, and radial velocity data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**O.

Angular and spectral differential imaging (ASDI) combines observations at different times and a range of wavelengths in order to separate the residual signal from the host star and the signal of interest corresponding to off-axis sources. *Aims.* Very high contrast detection is only possible with an accurate modeling of those two components, in particular of the background due to stellar leakages of the host star masked out by the coronagraph. Beyond the detection of point-like sources in the field of view, it is also essential to characterize the detection in terms of statistical significance and astrometry and to estimate the source spectrum. *Methods.* We extend our recent method PACO, based on local learning of patch covariances, in order to capture the spectral and temporal fluctuations of background structures. From this statistical modeling, we build a detection algorithm and a spectrum estimation method: PACO ASDI. The modeling of spectral correlations proves useful both in reducing detection artifacts and obtaining accurate statistical guarantees (detection thresholds and photometry confidence intervals). *Results.* An analysis of several ASDI datasets from the VLT/SPHERE-IFS instrument shows that PACO ASDI produces very clean detection maps, for which setting a detection threshold is statistically reliable. Compared to other algorithms used routinely to exploit the scientific results of SPHERE IFS, sensitivity is improved and many false detections can be avoided. Spectrally smoothed spectra are also produced by PACO ASDI. The analysis of datasets with injected fake planets validates the recovered spectra and the computed confidence intervals. *Conclusions.* PACO ASDI is a high-contrast processing algorithm accounting for the spatio-spectral correlations of the data to produce statistically-grounded detection maps and reliable spectral estimations.

Data reduction in ADI is challenging because the faint point sources are hidden in a stronger nonstationary background (speckles) displaying strong spatial correlations. PACO learns locally a statistical model of the background directly from the data. This model captures short-scale spatial correlations up to a separation of ten pixels (i.e., within an image patch). The decision in favor of the presence or the absence of an exoplanet is then performed by a binary hypothesis test. PACO offers appealing characteristics compared to existing detection approaches. Since no image subtraction is performed, the photometry is preserved. PACO is completely parameter-free, including the computation of a detection map, its thresholding to extract meaningful detections, and the estimation of fluxes of the detected sources. Finally, the resulting detection maps are stationary and statistically well-modeled so that the false alarm rate, the probability of detection, and the contrast can be directly assessed without post-processing and/or Monte-Carlo simulations. We have shown using datasets from the VLT/SPHERE-IRDIS instrument that the proposed method achieves significantly better detection performance than current cutting-edge algorithms such as TLOCI or KLIP. We believe that these significant practical advantages should make PACO a method of choice for the analysis of ADI observations, in particular for large exoplanet surveys. We have very recently extended this algorithm to the joint processing of the different spectral channels of angular and spectral differential imaging (ASDI) data. The resulting algorithm, named PACO-ASDI, accounts for the spatio-temporo-spectral fluctuations of the data. Our tests conducted on several ASDI datasets from the VLT/SPHERE-IFS instrument show that PACO-ASDI also produces reliable detection maps and unbiased spectral energy distribution of the detected sources (with confidence intervals), outperforming the state-of-the-art exoplanet hunter algorithms.","tags":[],"title":"Exoplanet detection in direct imaging by statistical learning of the non-stationary patch covariances","type":"other-communication"},{"authors":["**O.

In microscopy, in-line holography is a cost-effective method for characterizing microscopic objects. Based on the recording of a hologram, it allows a digital focusing in any plane of the imaged 3-D volume. In these two fields, the object detection problem is made difficult by the low contrast between the objects and the nonstationary background of the recorded images. In this thesis, we propose an unsupervised exoplanet detection and characterization algorithm based on the statistical modeling of background fluctuations. The method, based on a modeling of the statistical distribution of patches, captures their spatial covariances. It reaches a performance superior to state-of-the-art techniques on several datasets of the European high-contrast imager SPHERE operating at the Very Large Telescope. It produces statistically grounded and spatially-stationary detection maps in which detections can be performed at a constant probability of false alarm. It also produces photometrically unbiased spectral energy distributions of the detected sources. The use of a statistical model of the data leads to reliable photometric and astrometric accuracies. This methodological framework can be adapted to the detection of spatially-extended patterns in strong structured background, such as the diffraction patterns in holographic microscopy. We also propose robust approaches based on weighting strategies to reduce the influence of the numerous outliers present in real data. We show on holographic videos that the proposed weighting approach achieves a bias/variance tradeoff. In astronomy, the robustness improves the performance of our detection method in particular at close separations where the stellar residuals dominate. Our algorithms are adapted to benefit from the possible spectral diversity of the data, which improves the detection and characterization performance. All the algorithms developed are unsupervised: weighting and/or regularization parameters are estimated in a data-driven fashion. Beyond the applications in astronomy and microscopy, the signal processing methodologies introduced are general and could be applied to other detection and estimation problems.","tags":[],"title":"Object detection and characterization from faint signals in images: applications in astronomy and microscopy","type":"thesis-publication"},{"authors":["**O.

It requires an extreme adaptive-optics (AO) system and a coronagraph as well as suitable observing strategies. In angular differential imaging, the signal-to-noise ratio is improved by combining several observations. *Aims.* Due to the evolution of the observation conditions and of the AO correction, the quality of the observations may vary significantly during the observing sequence. It is common practice to reject images of comparatively poor quality. We aim to decipher when this selection should be performed and what its impact on detection performance is. *Methods.* Rather than discarding a full image, we study the local fluctuations of the signal at each frame and derive weighting maps for each frame. These fluctuations are modeled locally directly from the data through the spatio-temporal covariance of small image patches. The weights derived from the temporal variances can be used to improve the robustness of the detection step and reduce estimation errors of both the astrometry and photometry. The impact of bad frames can be analyzed by statistically characterizing the detection and estimation performance. *Results.* When used together with a modeling of the spatial covariances (PACO algorithm), these weights improve the robustness of the detection method. *Conclusions.* The spatio-temporal modeling of the background fluctuations provides a way to exploit all acquired frames. In the case of bad frames, areas with larger fluctuations are discarded by a weighting strategy and do not corrupt the detection map or the astrometric and photometric estimations.

Recent observations with SPHERE and NACO in the near-infrared (NIR) allowed us to detect a planetary mass companion, PDS 70 b, within the disk cavity. Moreover, observations in Hα with MagAO and MUSE revealed emission associated to PDS 70 b and to another new companion candidate, PDS 70 c, at a larger separation from the star. PDS 70 is the only multiple planetary system at its formation stage detected so far through direct imaging. *Aims.* Our aim is to confirm the discovery of the second planet PDS 70 c using SPHERE at VLT, to further characterize its physical properties, and search for additional point sources in this young planetary system. *Methods.* We re-analyzed archival SPHERE NIR observations and obtained new data in Y, J, H and K spectral bands for a total of four different epochs. The data were reduced using the data reduction and handling pipeline and the SPHERE data center. We then applied custom routines (e.g., ANDROMEDA and PACO) to subtract the starlight. *Results.* We re-detect both PDS 70 b and c and confirm that PDS 70 c is gravitationally bound to the star. We estimate this second planet to be less massive than 5 MJup and with a Teff around 900 K. Also, it has a low gravity with logg between 3.0 and 3.5 dex. In addition, a third object has been identified at short separation (~0.12′′) from the star and gravitationally bound to the star. Its spectrum is however very blue, meaning that we are probably seeing stellar light reflected by dust and our analysis seems to demonstrate that it is a feature of the inner disk. We cannot however completely exclude the possibility that it is a planetary mass object enshrouded by a dust envelope. In this latter case, its mass should be of the order of a few tens of M⊕. Moreover, we propose a possible structure for the planetary system based on our data, and find that this structure cannot be stable on a long timescale.","tags":[],"title":"VLT/SPHERE exploration of the young multiplanetary system PDS70","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**O.

Data reduction in ADI is challenging because the faint point sources are hidden in a stronger nonstationary background (speckles) displaying strong spatial correlations. PACO learns locally a statistical model of the background directly from the data. This model captures short-scale spatial correlations up to a separation of ten pixels (i.e., within an image patch). The decision in favor of the presence or the absence of an exoplanet is then performed by a binary hypothesis test. PACO offers appealing characteristics compared to existing detection approaches. Since no image subtraction is performed, the photometry is preserved. PACO is completely parameter-free, including the computation of a detection map, its thresholding to extract meaningful detections, and the estimation of fluxes of the detected sources. Finally, the resulting detection maps are stationary and statistically well-modeled so that the false alarm rate, the probability of detection, and the contrast can be directly assessed without post-processing and/or Monte-Carlo simulations. We have shown using datasets from the VLT/SPHERE-IRDIS instrument that the proposed method achieves significantly better detection performance than current cutting-edge algorithms such as TLOCI or KLIP. We believe that these significant practical advantages should make PACO a method of choice for the analysis of ADI observations, in particular for large exoplanet surveys. We have very recently extended this algorithm to the joint processing of the different spectral channels of angular and spectral differential imaging (ASDI) data. The resulting algorithm, named PACO-ASDI, accounts for the spatio-temporo-spectral fluctuations of the data. Our tests conducted on several ASDI datasets from the VLT/SPHERE-IFS instrument show that PACO-ASDI also produces reliable detection maps and unbiased spectral energy distribution of the detected sources (with confidence intervals), outperforming the state-of-the-art exoplanet hunter algorithms.","tags":[],"title":"Exoplanet detection in direct imaging by statistical learning of the non-stationary patch covariances – The PACO-based algorithms","type":"other-communication"},{"authors":["**O.

Nevertheless, the loss of the phase of the complex wavefront on the sensor can be critical in the reconstruction process. The simplicity of the setup must thus be counterbalanced by dedicated reconstruction algorithms, such as inverse approaches, in order to retrieve the object from its hologram. In the case of simple objects for which the diffraction pattern produced in the hologram plane can be modeled using few parameters, a model fitting algorithm is very effective. However, such an approach fails to reconstruct objects with more complex shapes, and an image reconstruction technique is then needed. The improved flexibility of these methods comes at the cost of a possible loss of reconstruction accuracy. In this work, we combine the two approaches (model fitting and regularized reconstruction) to benefit from their respective advantages. The sample to be reconstructed is modeled as the sum of simple parameterized objects and a complex-valued pixelated transmittance plane. These two components jointly scatter the incident illumination, and the resulting interferences contribute to the intensity on the sensor. The proposed hologram reconstruction algorithm is based on alternating a model fitting step and a regularized inversion step. We apply this algorithm in the context of fluid mechanics, where holograms of evaporating droplets are analyzed. In these holograms, the high contrast fringes produced by each droplet tend to mask the diffraction pattern produced by the surrounding vapor wake.

The very high contrast between the host star and its companions makes the detection particularly challenging. In addition to the use of an extreme adaptive optics system and a coronagraph to strongly attenuate the flux from the star, dedicated processing methods that combine images with different rotations of the field of view and at several wavelengths are required. The different temporal and spectral behaviors of the remaining stellar leakages and of the signal originating from the exoplanets make it possible to unmix them, and thus detect the planets and estimate their photometry. The integral-field spectrometer of a planet-finder such as SPHERE (Spectro-Polarimetry High-contrast Exoplanet REsearch) at the VLT provides 4-D spatio-spectro-temporal datasets. From a signal processing point of view, a major difficulty in the data analysis comes from the strong spatial and temporal fluctuations of the background that are due to (i) the speckle patterns (originating from the residual phase aberrations and misalignment of the coronagraph), and (ii) the detection noise and other perturbations (thermal noise, bad pixels) that are correlated by the interpolations performed during the data-reduction pipeline. Generally, images are combined following a particular strategy (based on angular / spectral differences, or by removing the principal components) in order to reduce the background level. After this processing, the residual fluctuations are assumed to be uncorrelated and the detection is performed by simple thresholding with a radially-decreasing threshold to account for the spatial variations of the level of the fluctuations. Based on our recently published paper, we propose to follow a different approach: we model the background correlations using a local Gaussian distribution that captures the spatial correlations at the scale of a patch of a few tens of pixels. The decision in favor of the presence or the absence of an exoplanet is then performed by a binary hypothesis test. This local modeling accounts for the spatial variations of the background fluctuations and leads to a detection method that is parameter-free. Moreover, we perform a joint estimation of the flux of a detected source and of the background to provide an intrinsically unbiased photometric estimate. We apply our method on datasets from two instruments of VLT/SPHERE: the dual-band differential instrument (IRDIS) and the integral field spectrograph (IFS). We compare the detection maps with standard techniques (TLOCI and KLIP) and show that our approach outperforms these algorithms with a much clearer difference between detection peaks at the actual location of sources and the small fluctuations in the background. We also show that the same statistical modeling can be used both at the detection step and to recover the spectrum of detected objects. We show that, thanks to the uniform response of the hypothesis test, a unique threshold can be applied to the detection maps to obtain consistent detection performance at all angular separations.","tags":[],"title":"Exoplanet detection in angular and spectral differential imaging by a local learning of background correlations","type":"other-communication"},{"authors":["A.

Exoplanet detection by direct imaging requires both dedicated instruments to mask out the host star and careful image processing methods. Data processing is challenging because the exoplanet signal is very faint and hidden in a much stronger non-stationary background displaying strong spatial correlations. In contrast to previous detection methods, we explicitly model the spatial correlations of the background and design a completely unsupervised method that accounts for the background non-stationarity. From a time series of observations, we learn a local model of the distribution of background patches. Significant sources are then detected with a generalized likelihood ratio test. The sub-pixel location and flux of each detected exoplanet are estimated jointly to a refining of the background model.

The main advantages of this technique are related to its simplicity, compactness, low sensitivity of the setup to vibrations and the possibility to accurately characterize objects. The cost-effectiveness of the method can be further increased using low-end laser diodes as coherent sources and CMOS color sensor equipped with a Bayer filter array. However, the central wavelength delivered by this type of laser is generally known only with a limited precision and can evolve because of its dependence on temperature and power supply voltage. In addition, Bayer-type filters of conventional color sensors are not very selective, resulting in spectral mixing (crosstalk phenomenon) of signals from each color channel. Ignoring these phenomena leads to significant errors in holographic reconstructions. We have proposed a maximum likelihood estimation method to calibrate the setup (central wavelength of the laser sources and spectral mixing introduced by the Bayer filters) using spherical objects naturally present in the field of view or added (calibration objects). This calibration method provides accurate estimates of the wavelengths and of the crosstalk, with an uncertainty comparable to that of a high-resolution spectrometer. To perform the image reconstruction from color holograms following the self-calibration of the setup, we describe a regularized inversion method that includes a linear hologram formation model, sparsity constraints and an edge-preserving regularization. We show on holograms of calibrated objects that the self-calibration of the setup leads to an improvement of the reconstructions.","tags":[],"title":"Improving color lensless microscopy reconstructions by self-calibration","type":"int-conf-publication"},{"authors":["T.

It requires sparsity of the sample but it is free from beam separation device and associated drawbacks. This option is particularly suited when cost, compact design or stability are important. This configuration is also easier to adapt on a traditional microscope. Finally, from the metrological point of view, this configuration, combined with parametric inverse reconstructions using Lorenz-Mie Theory, has proven to make possible highly accurate estimation of spherical particles parameters (3D location, radius and refractive index) with sub-micron accuracy. Experimental parameters such as the defocus distance, the choice of the objective, or the coherence of the source have a strong influence on the accuracy of the estimation. They are often studied experimentally on specific setups. We previously demonstrated the benefit of using statistical signal processing tools as the Cramér-Rao Lower Bounds to predict best theoretical accuracy reachable for opaque object. This accuracy depends on the image/hologram formation model, the noise model and the signal to noise ratio in the holograms. In a co-design framework, we propose here to investigate the influence of experimental parameters on the estimation of the radius and refractive index of micrometer-sized transparent spherical objects. In this context, we use Lorenz-Mie Theory to simulate spherical object holograms, to compute Cramér-Rao Lower bounds, and to numerically reconstruct the objects parameters using an inverse problem approach. Then, these theoretical studies are used to challenge our digital holographic microscopy setup and conclude about accuracy, limitations and possible enhancements.","tags":[],"title":"Optimizing phase object reconstruction using an in-line digital holographic microscope and a reconstruction based on a Lorenz Mie model","type":"int-conf-publication"},{"authors":["**O.

Even with the coupling of an extreme adaptive-optics system with a coronagraph, it remains challenging due to the very high contrast between the host star and the exoplanets. *Aims.* The purpose of this paper is to describe a method, named PACO, dedicated to source detection from angular differential imaging data. Given the complexity of the fluctuations of the background in the datasets, involving spatially variant correlations, we aim to show the potential of a processing method that learns the statistical model of the background from the data. *Methods.* In contrast to existing approaches, the proposed method accounts for spatial correlations in the data. Those correlations and the average stellar speckles are learned locally and jointly to estimate the flux of the (potential) exoplanets. By preventing from subtracting images including the stellar speckles residuals, the photometry is intrinsically preserved. A nonstationary multi-variate Gaussian model of the background is learned. The decision in favor of the presence or the absence of an exoplanet is performed by a binary hypothesis test. *Results.* The statistical accuracy of the model is assessed using VLT/SPHERE-IRDIS datasets. It is shown to capture the nonstationarity in the data so that a unique threshold can be applied to the detection maps to obtain consistent detection performance at all angular separations. This statistical model makes it possible to directly assess the false alarm rate, probability of detection, photometric and astrometric accuracies without resorting to Monte-Carlo methods. *Conclusions.* PACO offers appealing characteristics: it is parameter-free and photometrically unbiased. The statistical performance in terms of detection capability, photometric and astrometric accuracies can be straightforwardly assessed. A fast approximate version of the method is also described that can be used to process large amounts of data from exoplanets search surveys.","tags":[],"title":"Exoplanet detection in angular differential imaging by statistical learning of the nonstationary patch covariances – The PACO algorithm","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**O.

Nevertheless, this kind of interference imaging technique leads to a loss of the phase of the complex wave front on the sensor. This lack of phase information can be critical in the reconstruction process. Thus, the simplicity of the setup must be balanced by dedicated reconstruction algorithm to retrieve the object from its hologram, such as inverse approaches. In the case of simple objects for which an analytical model of propagation is known, parametric algorithms are very effective. But these approaches fail at reconstructing more complex objects, where non-parametric solutions must be involved. This may lead to a loss in precision or specificity. In this work we propose a new approach combining these two methods to take benefits from their own advantages. The object to reconstruction is split in two subparts. A part is described by a parametric model. The other part of the object is simulated via a nonparametric model. These two parts which interfere are jointly considered in the reconstruction algorithm by alternating parametric and non-parametric procedures. We apply this new technique to evaporating droplets where the high contrast fringes produced by the droplets tend to mask the fringes produced by the plume. With our method, both the droplet and the plume are jointly reconstructed.","tags":[],"title":"Auto-étalonnage d’un dispositif d’holographie couleur sans lentille et étude de performances","type":"other-communication"},{"authors":["**O.
